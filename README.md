# AirGes---A-Customizable-Wireless-PC-Controller-using-Machine-Learning-by-Hand-Gestures
This repository contains a Python-based hand gesture recognition system that allows users to control applications using simple hand gestures. The system leverages the MediaPipe framework for real-time hand tracking and finger counting. Users can interact with their computers hands-free, making it ideal for presentations, media playback, and more.
